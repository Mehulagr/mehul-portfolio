					<p> <b>Overview: </b>Ellie Mae is an <b>enterprise mortgage software</b> company. The company is working to automate and streamline the mortgage process from initial application to closing and selling of the loan in the secondary market. The software helps lenders lower the loan origination cost by automating services and significantly reducing the time to close the loan. Currently, ~40% of the mortgages in the United States pass through the software. Until recently, Ellie Mae was majorly a desktop client and is now moving its entire platform to the web, thus creating a web/mobile application for its users.</p><br>

          <p>As a UX designer at Ellie Mae, <b>my role</b> is focussed on designing experience for Ellie Mae’s Encompass platform (both web and mobile). I am also working with the design system team to unify, design and spec various web components for different Ellie Mae products.</p><br>

					<!-- <hr align="left" width="10%" style="margin: 10px 0px">
    					<h4 class="sub-heading">Subtitle</h4> -->
    					<p>Loan officers are the primary users of Ellie Mae’s flagship software, Encompass. Not only are they involved in each step of the loan process from loan origination to selling the loan, but their work also requires them to be on the go most of the time. Sometimes they visit borrowers homes, or at cafes to collect required documents and/or walk them through the terms of the loan. They sometimes set up shop at the realtors' office where they can build a relationship with the realtors and get referrals. The mobility of the loan officers means that they use other tools or hacks to supplement data into the encompass software, which has traditionally been a windows only application. Thus, the product team decided to make a major enhancement to the software by making it mobile and giving loan officers access to some major feature set wherever they are, whenever they want. </p><br>

              <!-- {Process}<br><br> -->

              <p>Since mobile was a new domain for Ellie Mae, we had to start with basics to understand what was important to the loan officers when they are on the go. I was involved right from the beginning of the project from user research to working with the developers during implementation. Some of my contributions to the project lifecycle are-</p>
              <ul>
                <li>A quick and dirty prototype for research</li>
                <li>Shadowed the UX researchers during the research and testing sessions</li>
                <li>Translated existing web architecture to the mobile context and re-designed the navigation patterns for the existing mobile app.</li>
                <li>Handed-off final UX requirements to visual designers in the form of high-fidelity mockups and specs.</li>
                <li>Worked with devs to get the right experience implemented.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>This project is protected under NDA. Please reach out on email/linkedIn for any questions and I would be more than happy to show more details.</p><br>

    					<h4 class="sub-heading">Subtitle</h4> -->
    					<p> Along with working on web and mobile platform for the encompass software, I have also been part of the design system team. During UI  sanity checks, we noticed a lot of inconsistencies in implementation due to the fact that certain components were hard-coded. They looked and ofter worked differently. Also, there was a lack of standard visual language within the design team which resulted in redundancy of effort. Thus, setting up a design system became the core of Ellie Mae’s transformation from the desktop client to the web platform. </p>
              <p>For designing components, we started looking at existing components and are trying to unify and make their definitions consistent across the board.  I have been talking to designers and product manager to understand the different use case for a component, particularly for their product. I have been translating these requirements to design interactions for the components. Some of the components that I have worked on are-</p>

    					<h4 class="sub-heading">Subtitle</h4>
    					<p>Usually desktop client such as Ellie Mae’s Encompass provide a lot of flexibility and power to users like Underwriters who thrive on this flexibility and power. Some of the tasks that they perform are- matching value from a document to values in the loan file to make sure all numbers are correct, moving around files and pages to make sure that all the documents are present and in right order. </p>
              <p>Bringing all those options on web is a challenging task, both from dev and design perspective. Thus, for this task I closely collaborated with the business analyst and researcher to understand the different use cases. I have actively been working with team to make sure users can achieve the same tasks that they did on desktop client but more easily. </p><br> -->
