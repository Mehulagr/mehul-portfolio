					<p> <b>Overview: </b>Ellie Mae is an enterprise mortgage software company. The company is trying to automate and streamline the mortgage process from initial application to closing and selling of the loan in secondary market. The software helps lenders lower the cost of loan by providing various services and significantly reduce the time to close the loan. Currently, 40% of the mortgages in United states pass through the software. Until recently, Ellie Mae was majorly a desktop client and is now moving its entire platform to web, thus creating a web/mobile application for its users. </p><br>

          <p>As a UX designer at Ellie Mae my role is focussed on designing experience for Ellie Mae’s Encompass platform (both web and mobile). I am also working with the design system team to unify, design and spec various web components for different Ellie Mae products.</p><br>

					<!-- Motorola Solutions specializes in public safety products like radio, wearable cameras, etc. Last summer, I was an UX Design and Research intern at 'Innovation and Design Lab' of Motorola Solutions where one of the project was to study the impact of self-driving cars on policing and other parallel project was to design a text based input system for facilitating informal communication between police officers.
					Self-driving cars are predicted to make a major impact on consumer market. But its consequence also changes policing, especially 'police patrol'. So one prompt was to understand how police patrol changes with self-driving car. I worked on another parallel project which involved designing a text based input system for police officers for their non-urgent communication (communication that they didn't do over radio to avoid wasting bandwidth).
					Conducted user research with police officers and used it to design interactions and experience of future police cars. Showed how it can decrease cognitive load experienced by officers and improve community relation. Additionally, designed and ran quantitative and qualitative usability testing on smart reply-based text input system for police officers. -->

    					<p> Loan Officers are really dynamic users. They spend most of their time outside the office. Their job demands them to work from different locations such as coffee shop, realtors office, borrowers house, etc. They also visit borrowers home or meet them at a coffee house to collect documents/ explain them terms. They also setup temporary office at realtors to build relationship with them and to work with them to help borrowers.  </p>
              <p>When on the go, a lot of loan officers carry a tablet or laptop so that they can view/ edit information. Sometimes they end up mailing their assistant to edit or view simple information. Other times they have make shift apps to access information. Thus, it was important to provide them a mobile solution.</p>
              <p>I worked with BA and PM to design quick and dirty wireframes which was then used for researching needs of the user by UX researcher. Combining the data from the research and product teams understanding, we were able to prioritize the features for the users.</p><br>

              {Process}<br><br>

              <p>Some of the feature that I worked on for mobile was redesign of IA and navigation of mobile, ability to work with documents (including view/ upload) on mobile, ability to order services like credit report on mobile. These features were tested with users in two seperate set of interviews.</p>
              <p>I would be more than happy to show more details in person.</p><br>

    					<p> Along with working on web and mobile offerings, I have been part of design system team. Whenever we were doing sanity checks, we noticed a lot of inconsistency in implementation mainly due to hard coded components and lack of standard visual language within design team. Thus, design system became the core for Ellie Mae’s transformation from desktop client to web platform. </p>
              <p>For designing components, I have been talking to designers and product manager to understand different use case for a component particularly for their product. Some of the components that I have worked on are-</p>

          <h4 style="color: black">Designing for power users</h4>
					<hr align="left" width="10%" style="margin: 10px 0px">
    					<h4 class="sub-heading">Subtitle</h4>
    					<p>Usually desktop client such as Ellie Mae’s Encompass provide a lot of flexibility and power to users like Underwriters who thrive on this flexibility and power. Some of the tasks that they perform are- matching value from a document to values in the loan file to make sure all numbers are correct, moving around files and pages to make sure that all the documents are present and in right order. </p>
              <p>Bringing all those options on web is a challenging task, both from dev and design perspective. Thus, for this task I closely collaborated with the business analyst and researcher to understand the different use cases. I have actively been working with team to make sure users can achieve the same tasks that they did on desktop client but more easily. </p><br>
